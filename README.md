This is MALWARE THIS IS TO BE USED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REDESTRIBUTE. DO NOT USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES!!!
How do I use it? (All files the decrypt.py, encrypt.py, and thekey.key must be transfered onto the victims computer.) The original password is "password". Misuse of this coding can result  in data loss or possible system damage.

1. Open Terminal/PowerShell/Console
2. Enter this command "python3 encrypt.py" to lock the files (Must be done inside the directory.)
3. (Password can be changed inside of the decrypt.py file.)
4. To unlock the files type in "python3 decrypt.py".
5. Congrats you used it successfully. (Again this is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY)
